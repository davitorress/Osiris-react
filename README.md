# Osiris-react
Osiris is an ongoing undergraduate project that promotes healthier eating through the use of Non-Conventional Food Plants (PANCs, a Brazilian acronym). It provides cultivation information, diverse recipes, and allows users to create their own recipes. The new mobile application is developed using React Native and Expo.
